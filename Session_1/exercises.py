# Exercise 1
first_number = input ("Enter a number")
second_number = input ("Enter another number")
# print(f"The total of your numbers is {int(first_number)+int(second_number)}") 

# Exercise 2
first_number = input ("Enter a number")
second_number = input ("Enter another number")
# print(f"Your numbers multiplied are {int(first_number)*int(second_number)}") 

# Exercise 3
distance_km = input ("How far are you going in kms?")
# print(f"You have {int(distance_km)*100} meters to go and {int(distance_km)*1000} centimeters to go")

#Exercise 5: Input function is an expression
