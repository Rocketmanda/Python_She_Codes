# Function Q1
# prompt = "Could I please have an integer?: "

# Define your function here
# def get_integer(x): # x = "Could I please have an integer?: "
#     result = int(input(x))
#     return result
    #return int(input(x))

# user_input = get_integer(prompt)
# print(f"So your integer is {user_input}? Thanks!")

# Function Q2 Solution 1 
# temperature = int(input("What is the temperature (Fahrenheit)? : "))
# print(f"Okay, so the temp in Fahrenheit is {temperature}...")
# def convert():
#     answer = float((temperature-32)*5/9)
#     print(f"Which means the temp in Celcius is {answer}")
# convert()

# Function Q2 Solution 2
# The first solution works fine, however, question wants us to define the celcius_convert function so that it takes a number
# Let's try to do it that way too

# degrees_f = 350 # you can simply change the value here to try other test cases

# def celcius_convert(temperature):
#     return float((temperature - 32) * 5/9)

# print(celcius_convert(degrees_f))
